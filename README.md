# Image Grayscale and Binarization Python

## 📄 Description 
This is a project in progress which aims to implement a custom script for image processing in Python, <img align="right" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/GoA7ZlBI2UfmGbf7Zy/giphy.webp?cid=790b7611qwtowwa2dl5tcupub2sfjljgoz56v900d1gboep3&ep=v1_stickers_search&rid=giphy.webp&ct=s" height="150" alt="Work in progress GIF">
without using external libraries.  The main goal is to convert a colored image into:
- **Grayscale levels** (0 to 255)
- **Binarized image** (black and white, 0 and 255)
The implementation must follow the principles proposed in class, focusing on building a custom function for the transformations.
